1. Disclaimer: I have only read things after 1.2.4.

2. Seperate subsection 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 from 1.2 as an independent section. You need to introduce signal and noise in neutrino telescopes first in that section. Before introducing trigger algorithms, you may first talk about that noise hits have in high frequency but do not have spacial or time correlation. Signal hits have strong correlations, as shown in Figure 8. This is the most important section in your first Chapter. You might need to further adjust this section after you have finished the other chapters. 

3. I am not sure for this point. How about bioluminescense? It will not be easy for Baikal to do the trigger. Though I understand you can not find good references for their methods.

> In lake water, salt such as K-40 is barely contained, so the noise bandwidth is not super high. 

4. Add space before "(".
5. Figure 7, I find the logo of Grammarly.
6. Where is your references?
